## Thermocouple-calibrator

This app provides a collection of thermocouple calibration tools for use with the standard thermocouple reference functions.

----
### Targeted user groups:

Students, Scientists, Engineers

----
### Purposes

* To calibrate for the measuring junction temperature of a basic thermocouple circuit based on the reference junction temperature and the voltmeter measurement provided by the user;
* To compute the reference function and its inverse for a specific thermocouple type*, using input value provided by the user. The exact working of the computation is displayed;
* To display the graphs of the reference functions and the Seebeck coefficients of the thermocouple types*;
* To provide various implementations of the reference function computation. Currently available in C, Java and Python, these packages are downloadable on the app's website, and the source codes within each package are viewable in a browser;

The app also provides the following subsidiary functionalities:

* Online access to the database of reference functions implemented by this app;
* A quick reference on the basic properties of each thermocouple type, including their chemical compositions, effective temperature ranges and recommended uses.

*The data on the thermocouple types are provided by the NIST SRD60 database.
